# AsK-LS

This repository contains code implementing the algorithm proposed by Mingzhen He, Fan He, Lei Shi, Xiaolin Huang and Johan A.K. Suykens in [*Learning with Asymmetric Kernels : Least Squares and Feature Interpretation*]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01397) \
It was written by Antoine Xie and Edmond You as part of the Summer Research Internship - Project 58 Advanced Kernel Methods or Machine Learning at Shanghai Jiao Tong University

There a two implementations, one solving in the primal space and the other one in the dual space. Tests are provided to show the usage
